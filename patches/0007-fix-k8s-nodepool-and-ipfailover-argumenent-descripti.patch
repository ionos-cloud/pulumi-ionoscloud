 ⚠️ **Note**:
 
 Be careful when using `auto_scaling` since the number of nodes can change. Because of that, when running
-`terraform plan`, Terraform will think that an update is required (since `node_count` from the `tf` plan will be different
-from the number of nodes set by the scheduler). To avoid that, you can use:
-```hcl
-lifecycle {
-    ignore_changes = [
-      node_count
-    ]
-  }
-```
+`terraform plan`, An update will be considered required (since `node_count` from the `tf` plan will be different
+from the number of nodes set by the scheduler). To avoid that, you can use `ignore_changes`.
 This will also ignore the manual changes for `node_count` made in the `tf` plan.
 You can read more details about the `ignore_changes` attribute [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle).
