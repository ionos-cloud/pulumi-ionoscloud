/**
 * The **VPN IPSec Gateway data source** can be used to search for and return an existing IPSec Gateway.
 * You can provide a string for the name parameter which will be compared with provisioned IPSec Gateways.
 * If a single match is found, it will be returned. If your search results in multiple matches, an error will be returned.
 * When this happens, please refine your search string so that it is specific enough to return only one result.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### By ID
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as ionoscloud from "@pulumi/ionoscloud";
 *
 * const example = ionoscloud.vpn.getIpsecGateway({
 *     id: "gateway_id",
 *     location: "gateway_location",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### By Name
 *
 * Needs to have the resource be previously created, or a dependsOn clause to ensure that the resource is created before
 * this data source is called.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as ionoscloud from "@pulumi/ionoscloud";
 *
 * const example = ionoscloud.vpn.getIpsecGateway({
 *     name: "ipsec-gateway",
 *     location: "gateway_location",
 * });
 * ```
